To get started quickly, you can use the included sample dataset or prepare your own file with a similar structure. The app expects the following columns (case-insensitive):

| Column Name | Description                               | Example Values                                              |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name        | Full name of the student                  | "Aarav Patel", "Neha Shah"                                  |
| Email       | Student's email address                   | "[aarav.patel@example.com](mailto:aarav.patel@example.com)" |
| Branch      | Academic branch or department             | "Computer Science", "Mechanical"                            |
| Year        | Year of study                             | 1, 2, 3, 4                                                  |
